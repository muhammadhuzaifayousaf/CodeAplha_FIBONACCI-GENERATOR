# Fibonacci Generator

This Python project generates a Fibonacci sequence, analyzes its ratios, and visualizes the sequence along with the approximation of the Golden Ratio.

## Overview

The project consists of three main components:
1. **Fibonacci Generator**: Generates a specified number of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Analysis**: Calculates ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers and approximates the Golden Ratio.
3. **Visualization**: Displays plots of the Fibonacci sequence and its ratios using matplotlib, including an approximation of the Golden Ratio.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

2. **Installation**: No installation is required beyond Python itself.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
   - Run `python fibonacci.py` in your terminal.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

4. **Output**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence will be printed to the console.
   - The approximate Golden Ratio and ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers will be displayed.
   - Two plots will be shown:
     - Fibonacci sequence plot showing values over indices.
     - Golden Ratio approximation plot displaying ratios and the theoretical Golden Ratio line.

## Dependencies

- matplotlib: Required for plotting the Fibonacci sequence and ratios.
